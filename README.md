# Alzheimer-s-Disease_detection
This Python script implements an end-to-end image classification pipeline using transfer learning with three powerful pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: ResNet101, EfficientNetB7, and DenseNet201. The pipeline is designed for multi-class classification using a custom dataset with four categories.
